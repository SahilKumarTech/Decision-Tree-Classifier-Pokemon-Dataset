# Decision-Tree-Classifier-Pokemon-Dataset
Machine learning project demonstrating Decision Tree classification on the Pokémon dataset. The notebook covers dataset exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

This project applies a **Decision Tree Classifier** on the **Pokémon dataset** to predict Pokémon characteristics.  
The notebook covers data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation with visualizations.

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Load Dataset** – Pokémon dataset (`pokemon.csv`).
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Explore distributions, correlations, and insights.
3. **Data Preprocessing** – Encode features and prepare dataset.
4. **Model Training** – Train a Decision Tree Classifier with scikit-learn.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Evaluate using:
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
6. **Visualization** – Plot decision tree and model performance.
